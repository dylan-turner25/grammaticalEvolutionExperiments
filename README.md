# grammaticalEvolutionExperiments
Experimenting with using grammatical evolution to recover functional forms for unknown data generating processes. The rendered R notebook can be viewed at https://rpubs.com/dylan_turner25/pwe


# Overview
This notebook runs a simulation to experiment with using grammatical evolution to recover an unknown functional form for a probability weighting function. In economics it is often proposesd that individuals persistently distort probabilities or engage in “probability weighting”. Finding a functional form that maps the objective probabilities into the subjective decision probabilities that individuals are using to make choices would be a great asset in analyzing human behavior. I doubt a susinct functional representation exists. This simulation however tests to see if grammatical evolution could be used as a tool to recover the functional form that best maps the objective probability to the weighted decision probability.
